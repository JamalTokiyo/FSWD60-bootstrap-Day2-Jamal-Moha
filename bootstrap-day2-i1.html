<h5> HTML</h5>
<p> HTML is the HyperText Markup Language for describing web pages. HyperText is the method by which you move around on the web — by clicking on special text called hyperlinks which bring you to the next page. The fact that it is hyper just means it is not linear — i.e. you can go to any place on the internet whenever you want by clicking on links — there is no set order to do things in. HTML is not a programming language</p>
